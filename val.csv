Purpose      \nThe purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines that are specific to Mastek UK regarding \nharassment. This policy applies to all employees on Company standard terms and conditions. \nIt may/may not apply to employees on non -standard terms and conditi ons. Please contact \nHR if clarification is required of how this policy applies.    \n34.2.  Introduction     \n34.2.1.  In line with the Mastek Value of Respect for the Individual and in support of the \nEqual Opportunities policy, it is the Company's intention th at all employees have a \nright to be treated with dignity, that any form of harassment at work will not be \npermitted or condoned and that employees have a right to report complaints of \nharassment should it occur. These guidelines cover work and work -related  social \nevents (formal or informal). Work related social events constitute an extension of \nthe workplace.      \n34.2.2.

If an employee believes that he or she is being harassed then, depending on the \ncircumstances, he or she can choose to deal with this either formally or informally. \nIt is not necessary f or the informal route to have been exhausted before the formal \nroute is invoked. However, in some cases an informal approach, either by the \nemployee, or the employee and someone who the employee has asked to support \nhim or her, is often enough to prevent a  repeat of any unwanted behaviour and \nresolve the problem. Details of all of the options which are available to the employee \nif he or she believes that he or she is being harassed are set out below.   \n        \n34.3.  What is Harassment ?     \nHarassment may b e defined as unwanted or offensive behaviour by one or more \nemployee(s) towards another.

This Policy is not contractual but sets out the standards \nwe expect.     \n33.1.2.  We aim to b e fair and reasonable, and for our requirements to apply with equal \nformality to both sexes. Should any employee have any difficulty in complying with \nour dress code on grounds of sex, race, disability, religion, belief or sexual \norientation, please raise this initially with your Line Manager, and failing a \nsatisfactory resolution, through the Grievance Procedure. Employees are permitted \nto wear clothing required by their religion if this has no detrimental impact on \nperforming their role successfully.   \n   \n33.2.  Client Perception     \nOur overall consideration is that whilst casual business attire is now the norm in many \nsections of the business, each individual employee is required to dress appropriately \naccording to the nature of his/her job and the enviro nment in which he/she works.

For anyone scheduled \nto meet internal and external customers directly, this will almost always mean  a suit \nand tie for men (or similar level of formality and smartness), with equivalent formal \nbusiness attire for women.  Business dress is not obligatory in other areas, but the \noverall impression should still be smart.  For example, shirts should have co llars, \njeans (of any colour), trainers, sports shirts or shorts are not considered appropriate \nfor those working within our offices.     \n33.3.2.  Friday is currently designated a ""dress down"" day. There will be a notice on Reception \ninforming visitors that t his is the practice.  Anyone scheduling a meeting may invite \nvisitors to also dress down if they wish.     \n33.3.3.  Mastek (UK) Limited reserves the right to cease the practice of ""dress down"" days     \nif at any stage we feel this is compromising our reputa tion or adversely affecting \nour business.     \n   \n33.4.

2,What is Mastek's policy regarding age discrimination in the workplace?,"[""Division : HRD   Doc. Name :Code of Business  Conduct & Ethics   Version : 4.2   \nDocument Classification: Internal   Date : 20-Nov-2020 Page : 34 of 38   \n39.9.  Age     \nDiscrimination against a person on the grounds of their actual or perceived age (whether \nyounger or older) is unacceptable and Mastek is committed to ensuring equality of opportunity \nfor all employees regardless of age.   \n   \n   \n39.10.  Disability and Reasonable Adjustments     \nPurpose: If a Mastekeer has a disability or has become disabled, Mastek is required under \nthe Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to make reasonable adjustments to  ensure that the \nemploye e can effectively do his work. The range of conditions which qualify under this \nlegislation is wide and can include both physical and mental conditions, for example: \nmobility, sight, hearing, diabetes, dyslexia, thyroid conditions, schizophrenia, stress and \ndepression. The impact these conditions have on an employee’s ability to do his job must \nbe significant  and will normally have already  lasted for 12 months or be expected to last for \n12 months. If there is a possibility of the ill ness or condition being covered by the Disability \nDiscrimination Act, the Mastekeer must talk to his Manager or HR Manager at the earliest \nopportunit y. Alternatively, he can record details of your disability within Employee Self - \nService which will alert h is HR Manager to your disability. Informing the Company of the \nMastekeer’s disability will allow us to obtain the best advice to help him. This will usually \ninvolve working with the individual and our independent Occupational Health Adviser to \nensure that any adjustments we make will enable the employee to fulfill your his potential. \nThe advice we receive will enable reasonable adjustments to be made which may involve \nacquiring special equipment for the concerned employee like a keyboard or special chair, \narranging transport or making adjustments to the employee’s working arrangements, such \nas altering working hours or transferring you to fill an alternative vacancy. These are just \nexamples and reasonable adjustments will be defined according to the Mastekee r’s \ncircumstances and the Company's operational needs. In order to assist us with making \nadjustments, the Mastekeer should inform us of any needs, or changes to needs, as soon \nas possible. Discrimination and harassment on the grounds of a person's disabili ty, such as \nviolating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or \noffensive environment will not be tolerated in any form.   \n   \n39.11.  HIV and AIDS     \nMastek recognizes that HIV is a workplace issue and wishes to res pond sensitively and \npractically to the difficult challenges that HIV and AIDS can present at work. Discrimination \nagainst employees including harassment, spreading rumors about an employee's suspected \nHIV status or a refusal to work with an employee livin g with or affected by HIV and AIDS \nwill not be tolerated. The HIV status of an employee is personal information that should \nnot be recorded in any way that may be easily accessible and should not be shared without \nthe employee's consent. Sickness and medic al certificates supplied to HR will be kept \nconfidential, unless the employee consents to any further disclosure. If an employee learns \nof a colleague's HIV status, they must not disclose this information without the individual's \nexplicit consent. Similarl y, any advice or information about HIV or AIDS sought by an \nemployee should remain confidential. We will make every reasonable effort to enable \nHIVpositive employees to remain in employment and we will work with them to make \nreasonable adjustments to their  role where this is appropriate.    \n   \n39.12.  Harassment & Bullying     \nHarassment can be described as behavior that is unwanted, unwelcome and undermines a \nperson's dignity at work. It is behavior which a Mastekeer, a colleague, a client or a supplier \nfinds intimidating, upsetting, embarrassing, humiliating or personally offensive. \nHarassment may or may not be connected to discrimination. Harassment in any form will \nnot be tolerated within Mastek. Certain conduct may be offensive to employees, even if it \nis not directed at them. It is immaterial whether harassment is intentional or not. It is the \neffect that the behavior has on the recipient that makes the behavior unacceptable.

If an employee believes that he or she is being harassed then, depending on the \ncircumstances, he or she can choose to deal with this either formally or informally. \nIt is not necessary f or the informal route to have been exhausted before the formal \nroute is invoked. However, in some cases an informal approach, either by the \nemployee, or the employee and someone who the employee has asked to support \nhim or her, is often enough to prevent a  repeat of any unwanted behaviour and \nresolve the problem. Details of all of the options which are available to the employee \nif he or she believes that he or she is being harassed are set out below.   \n        \n34.3.

If an employee feels that s/he is being discriminated against, or if s/he believes that \nsomeone else's behavior, including that of a client or a supplier is potentially \ndiscriminatory, they should talk to their M anager or HR Manager immediately. If they \ndo not feel comfortable raising the issue with either of those people, the employee can \ncontact one of the Directors. Mastekeers also have the option of raising a formal \ngrievance under the Company's grievance proc edure if the matter cannot be resolved \ninformally or is too serious for an informal approach to be appropriate. The claim will \nbe investigated fully and disciplinary action could be taken if discrimination is proven. \nIn the event of a claim of discriminati on by a client or supplier, the Company will notify \na senior member of their organization, so that they may take appropriate action. In \nsuch circumstances, the Company will also take steps to ensure that our employees are \nfully supported and, if appropriat e, moved away from any such unwanted or \nunacceptable behavior.    \n   \n39.5.  Gender and gender identity    \nMastek will not tolerate any discrimination on the grounds of a person's gender. This \nincludes treating someone less favorably because they are on mate rnity leave. Sexual \nharassment is any harassing conduct which is based on the gender of the recipient and it \nis not permitted in any form. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome advances or other \nconduct of a sexual nature, sending jokes or e -mails of a s exually offensive nature, gestures \nor explicit pictures or words, or any other conduct which leaves the recipient feeling \nthreatened or compromised.    \n   \n39.6.

These are a \nbelief in a Supreme Being, worship of that Supreme Being and the exist ence of a group of \npeople who observe a set of beliefs, values, customs and practices set down by and through \nthe Supreme Being. Generally, belief does not cover philosophical or political beliefs. \nDiscrimination or harassment on the grounds of actual or p erceived religion or beliefs is not \nacceptable.

Any allegations of harassment will be fully investigated. Harassment can take a \nnumber of forms. This is by no means an exhaustive list but examples ar e non verbal, \nverbal and physical.    \n   \n      \n39.13.  Bullying     \nBullying is not dissimilar to harassment. However it usually involves the misuse of power \nor intimidation, leaving the individual feeling hurt, vulnerable, compromised, threatened, \ndisengag ed, angry or helpless. Examples of potentially bullying behavior include: public \nhumiliation, put -downs or ridicule, this can  also occur via email, reprimanding an employee \nin front of other employees when this could be done in  private, personal insults and name \ncalling, instantaneous rages, often over trivial matters, persistent  criticism, singling out an \nemployee for unjustified criticism, withholding essential information, removing  areas of \nresponsibility without consultation, requiring menial tasks to be undertaken frequently \nwhich may be deemed inappropriate to a person's role, aggressive behavior or threats \ndirected at an employee, including verbal abuse,  turning  own leave for no objective \nreason, persistent placing of excessive demands on employ ees, setting of unrealistic targets \nor objectives, or the changing of targets or objectives without good reason, manner of  \naddressing an employee, physical attacks , deliberate and wrongful attributions of blame. \nBullying should  not be confused with legi timate actions by a Manager to encourage an \nimprovement in an employee's  performance such as: negative feedback from your \nManager or a client which is intended as constructive  comment, defining areas for personal \nimprovement(s), reasonable instructions g iven to you by the  manager or a client, \nperformance management and the setting of work related targets and objectives or  \nappropriate action taken under the Disciplinary and Grievance Policy or a Personal \nImprovement Plan.    \nIf a Mastekeer believes that someone else's behavior, including that of a client or supplier, \nis personally offensive, socially unacceptable or fails to respect an individual’s rights as an \nindividual, the concerned person should tell them their behavior is unwelcome and give \nthem som e examples. In some instances this will solve the problem, as they may be  \nunaware of the effect their behavior is having . If the employee feels unable to approach \nthe individual or if the harassment or bullying continues, they should make a diary note of  \ndates, times and incidents and must speak with their Manager as soon as they feel able. If \nthe Mastekeer is unable to do this they should talk to their HR. Where they believe bullying \nis occurring, they will speak to the harasser on your behalf to make it  clear that the behavior \nis unacceptable and that it must stop. If the harassment is serious in nature the matter will \nbe fully investigated and this may lead to disciplinary action and potentially dismissal if an \nemployee is found to have acted in this wa y. As a permanent or temporary Mastek \nemployee, each employee is responsible for ensuring that they do not, by their own actions, \nbehaviors or attitudes, discriminate against, harass or bully fellow employees, clients, \nsuppliers and other people with whom they come into contact whilst carrying out work. If \na Mastekeer sees someone, or are aware of someone being harassed or bullied, they should \ntalk with them and see how best they can help. It may be they are unwilling or frightened \nto raise the issue formal ly. If they think this is the case, they should offer to talk to either \ntheir Manager or HR on their behalf. If the individual feels uncomfortable about dealing \nwith issues such as these, or feels s/he does not have the skills required, they ought to \nbring this to their Manager's attention or to the attention of your HR Manager. Where this \ninformal approach fails, they will need to raise a formal Grievance so that the manager or \nHR can investigate the matter. This will be dealt with quickly, thoroughly and confidentially. \nA complete record of the complaint and investigation will be kept by HR. In some cases, it \nmay be appropriate to work with an external, impartial mediator to resolve issues. \nMediation would be used only where all parties agree to the proces s, is entirely voluntary \nand would be conducted in private with absolute confidentiality. If it is found that an""

Bullying (behaviour directed against an individual which is intimidating, offensive or \nmalicious and which undermines the confidence and  self-esteem of the recipient)   \n34.4.7.  Unwanted physical attention     \n34.4.8.  These examples are not exclusive or exhaustive. Threatened or actual violence of \nany kind is an obvious example of gross misconduct, which if found is likely to result \nin summ ary dismissal. Other actions, however, may also constitute gross \nmisconduct depending on the circumstances and the seriousness of the case in \nquestion.     \nWhilst these guidelines do not cover harassment from client personnel, or other business \ncontacts, e mployees are urged to report such incidents to their manager or HR. Such \nincidents will again be taken extremely seriously and the Company will make every \nreasonable endeavour to resolve or prevent a re -occurrence.   \n   \n34.5.  Dealing with Harassment Compla ints   \n   \n34.5.1.  Resolving Problems Informally     \n34.5.1.1.   Employees should ideally, if possible, to attempt to resolve the problem informally \nin the first instance. In some cases it may possible and sufficient for the employee \nto explain clearly to th e individual engaging in the unwanted conduct that the \nbehaviour in question is unwelcome, that it offends them or makes them \nuncomfortable or interferes with their work.    \n34.5.1.2.  In circumstances where it is too difficult or embarrassing for an employ ee to \nresolve the problem on his or her own, for example where the person they believe \nis harassing them is their Manager, an alternative approach would be to discuss \ntheir concerns with HR or one of the directors. If the employee would prefer to \nraise the  problem in the first instance to someone of his/her own sex, he/she may \nchoose another Manager/HR Representative as appropriate. The person the \nemployee approaches, will, if the employee is in agreement, and it is appropriate, \nsupport the employee in faci litating discussions with the individual engaging in the \nunwanted conduct on an informal confidential basis to try and resolve the \nproblem.    \n \n34.5.2.  Resolving Problems formally –Grievance Procedure     \nIf after an informal approach, the unwanted conduct  continues or if the employee believes \nit is not appropriate to try and resolve the problem informally, the employee should refer to \nthe formal procedure in the Grievance Policy.    \n   \n34.5.3.  Employee Responsibilities     \n34.5.3.1.   All employees have a r esponsibility to help to ensure a working environment in \nwhich the dignity of employees is respected. Managers have a particular duty to \nensure that no form of harassment occurs in areas for which they are responsible.     \n34.5.3.2.   Managers are expected to communicate to those for whom they are responsible, \nthat they are available at any time to discuss issues.

Smokers will not be allowed longer or more frequent \nbreaks than their non -smoking colleague s and use of the smoking areas is not to \ninterfere with normal job performance. Smoking areas  will be kept clean and well \nventilated, but staff using these areas will also be expected to keep them tidy and \nto dispose of any rubbish appropriately. Receptac les are provided for the disposal \nof cigarette ends and other waste smoking materials. Cigarettes, cigars and pipes \nmust be extinguished using the receptacles provided and smokers should ensure \nthat there is no risk of fire. These areas will be monitored t o ensure an acceptable \nstandard of housekeeping and adherence to safety. If not maintained properly, the \nfacility may be withdrawn.    \n35.9.2.  Failure to dispose of cigarette litter properly outside the building can result in the \nperson being fined by the local authority. Refusal to pay can result in a court fine.'

Name :Code of Business  Conduct & Ethics   Version : 4.2   \nDocument Classification: Internal   Date : 20-Nov-2020 Page : 34 of 38   \n39.9.  Age     \nDiscrimination against a person on the grounds of their actual or perceived age (whether \nyounger or older) is unacceptable and Mastek is committed to ensuring equality of opportunity \nfor all employees regardless of age.   \n   \n   \n39.10.  Disability and Reasonable Adjustments     \nPurpose: If a Mastekeer has a disability or has become disabled, Mastek is required under \nthe Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to make reasonable adjustments to  ensure that the \nemploye e can effectively do his work. The range of conditions which qualify under this \nlegislation is wide and can include both physical and mental conditions, for example: \nmobility, sight, hearing, diabetes, dyslexia, thyroid conditions, schizophrenia, stress and \ndepression. The impact these conditions have on an employee’s ability to do his job must \nbe significant  and will normally have already  lasted for 12 months or be expected to last for \n12 months. If there is a possibility of the ill ness or condition being covered by the Disability \nDiscrimination Act, the Mastekeer must talk to his Manager or HR Manager at the earliest \nopportunit y. Alternatively, he can record details of your disability within Employee Self - \nService which will alert h is HR Manager to your disability. Informing the Company of the \nMastekeer’s disability will allow us to obtain the best advice to help him. This will usually \ninvolve working with the individual and our independent Occupational Health Adviser to \nensure that any adjustments we make will enable the employee to fulfill your his potential. \nThe advice we receive will enable reasonable adjustments to be made which may involve \nacquiring special equipment for the concerned employee like a keyboard or special chair, \narranging transport or making adjustments to the employee’s working arrangements, such \nas altering working hours or transferring you to fill an alternative vacancy. These are just \nexamples and reasonable adjustments will be defined according to the Mastekee r’s \ncircumstances and the Company's operational needs. In order to assist us with making \nadjustments, the Mastekeer should inform us of any needs, or changes to needs, as soon \nas possible. Discrimination and harassment on the grounds of a person's disabili ty, such as \nviolating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or \noffensive environment will not be tolerated in any form.   \n   \n39.11.  HIV and AIDS     \nMastek recognizes that HIV is a workplace issue and wishes to res pond sensitively and \npractically to the difficult challenges that HIV and AIDS can present at work. Discrimination \nagainst employees including harassment, spreading rumors about an employee's suspected \nHIV status or a refusal to work with an employee livin g with or affected by HIV and AIDS \nwill not be tolerated. The HIV status of an employee is personal information that should \nnot be recorded in any way that may be easily accessible and should not be shared without \nthe employee's consent. Sickness and medic al certificates supplied to HR will be kept \nconfidential, unless the employee consents to any further disclosure. If an employee learns \nof a colleague's HIV status, they must not disclose this information without the individual's \nexplicit consent. Similarl y, any advice or information about HIV or AIDS sought by an \nemployee should remain confidential. We will make every reasonable effort to enable \nHIVpositive employees to remain in employment and we will work with them to make \nreasonable adjustments to their  role where this is appropriate.    \n   \n39.12.  Harassment & Bullying     \nHarassment can be described as behavior that is unwanted, unwelcome and undermines a \nperson's dignity at work. It is behavior which a Mastekeer, a colleague, a client or a supplier \nfinds intimidating, upsetting, embarrassing, humiliating or personally offensive. \nHarassment may or may not be connected to discrimination. Harassment in any form will \nnot be tolerated within Mastek. Certain conduct may be offensive to employees, even if it \nis not directed at them.

Mastekeers also have the option of raising a formal \ngrievance under the Company's grievance proc edure if the matter cannot be resolved \ninformally or is too serious for an informal approach to be appropriate. The claim will \nbe investigated fully and disciplinary action could be taken if discrimination is proven. \nIn the event of a claim of discriminati on by a client or supplier, the Company will notify \na senior member of their organization, so that they may take appropriate action. In \nsuch circumstances, the Company will also take steps to ensure that our employees are \nfully supported and, if appropriat e, moved away from any such unwanted or \nunacceptable behavior.    \n   \n39.5.  Gender and gender identity    \nMastek will not tolerate any discrimination on the grounds of a person's gender. This \nincludes treating someone less favorably because they are on mate rnity leave.

These are a \nbelief in a Supreme Being, worship of that Supreme Being and the exist ence of a group of \npeople who observe a set of beliefs, values, customs and practices set down by and through \nthe Supreme Being. Generally, belief does not cover philosophical or political beliefs. \nDiscrimination or harassment on the grounds of actual or p erceived religion or beliefs is not \nacceptable.
