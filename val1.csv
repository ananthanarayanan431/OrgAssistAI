If an employee feels that s/he is being discriminated against, or if s/he believes that \nsomeone else's behavior, including that of a client or a supplier is potentially \ndiscriminatory, they should talk to their M anager or HR Manager immediately. If they \ndo not feel comfortable raising the issue with either of those people, the employee can \ncontact one of the Directors. Mastekeers also have the option of raising a formal \ngrievance under the Company's grievance proc edure if the matter cannot be resolved \ninformally or is too serious for an informal approach to be appropriate. The claim will \nbe investigated fully and disciplinary action could be taken if discrimination is proven. \nIn the event of a claim of discriminati on by a client or supplier, the Company will notify \na senior member of their organization, so that they may take appropriate action. In \nsuch circumstances, the Company will also take steps to ensure that our employees are \nfully supported and, if appropriat e, moved away from any such unwanted or \nunacceptable behavior.    \n   \n39.5.  Gender and gender identity    \nMastek will not tolerate any discrimination on the grounds of a person's gender. This \nincludes treating someone less favorably because they are on mate rnity leave. Sexual \nharassment is any harassing conduct which is based on the gender of the recipient and it \nis not permitted in any form. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome advances or other \nconduct of a sexual nature, sending jokes or e -mails of a s exually offensive nature, gestures \nor explicit pictures or words, or any other conduct which leaves the recipient feeling \nthreatened or compromised.    \n   \n39.6.  Race     \nTreating someone less favorably as a result of their race or ethnic or national origin s is \nunlawful and will not be tolerated in any form within Mastek. Racial harassment can include \nderogatory remarks, racially explicit statements or jokes, stereotyping and 'nicknames'. Such \nbehavior is unacceptable.     \n   \n39.7.  Sexual Orientation     \nTreating someone less favorably as a result of their sexual orientation is unlawful and will \nnot be tolerated in any form. Discrimination on the basis of a person's actual or perceived \nsexual orientation is not acceptable.     \n \n39.8.  Religion and Belief     \nFor the purposes of the regulations governing discrimination on religion and belief, there are \nthree essential elements that are necessary to meet the definition of religion. These are a \nbelief in a Supreme Being, worship of that Supreme Being and the exist ence of a group of \npeople who observe a set of beliefs, values, customs and practices set down by and through \nthe Supreme Being. Generally, belief does not cover philosophical or political beliefs. \nDiscrimination or harassment on the grounds of actual or p erceived religion or beliefs is not \nacceptable.

We must all work to ensure prompt and consistent action ag ainst violations of this Code. \nHowever, in some situations there may be “gray areas” for which it may be difficult to know \nthe right thing to do. Since we cannot anticipate every situation that will arise, it is important \nthat we have a way to approach a n ew question or problem. These are some steps to keep \nin mind:     \n \n30.2. Make sure you have all the facts. In order to reach the right solutions, we must be as fully \ninformed as possible.  \n    \n30.3. Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do? D oes it seem unethical or improper? \nThis will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with, and the alternatives \nyou have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems unethical or improper, \nit probably is.     \n \n30.4. Clarify yo ur responsibility and role. In most situations, there is shared responsibility. Are your \ncolleagues informed? It may help to get others involved and discuss the problem.   \n   \n30.5. Discuss the problem with your Supervisor. This is the basic guidance for al l situations. In many \ncases, your Supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the question, and will appreciate \nbeing brought into the decision -making process. Remember that it is your Supervisor's \nresponsibility to help solve problems.     \n \n30.6. Seek hel p from the Organization ’s resources. In the rare case in which it may not be \nappropriate to discuss an issue with your Supervisor or where you do not feel comfortable \napproaching your Supervisor with your question, discuss it with the Head of Human \nResourc es.     \n \n30.7. Your report of violations of this Code is in confidence and without fear of retaliation. \nConfidentiality will be observed in connection with any reports under this Code and disclosure \nof information will be made only as reasonably necessary to conduct a legallyrequired \ninvestigation. The Organization  does not permit retaliation of any kind against Stakeholders \nfor good faith reports of violations of this Code or questionable accounting or auditing \nmatters. “Good faith” does not mean that you have to be right – but it does mean that you \nbelieve that you are providing truthful information. The important thing is that you bring your \nquestion or concern to our attention through one of the available channels.    \n \n30.8. Always ask first, act later. If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek guidance \nbefore you act.     \n \nNote : In case of statutory regulations of a particular country with respect to any of the sections \nmentioned in this Code of Conduct and Business Ethics being different, t he former provisions will \noverride that which has been stated in this document.

Introduction     \n33.1.1.  Our employees are ambassadors for our business, and represent us whenever they \nmeet customers. We, therefore, a sk that their appearance and conduct present us \nin a professional light at all times.  For this reason, we have introduced the following \nPolicy on business dress.  This Policy is not contractual but sets out the standards \nwe expect.     \n33.1.2.  We aim to b e fair and reasonable, and for our requirements to apply with equal \nformality to both sexes. Should any employee have any difficulty in complying with \nour dress code on grounds of sex, race, disability, religion, belief or sexual \norientation, please raise this initially with your Line Manager, and failing a \nsatisfactory resolution, through the Grievance Procedure. Employees are permitted \nto wear clothing required by their religion if this has no detrimental impact on \nperforming their role successfully.   \n   \n33.2.  Client Perception     \nOur overall consideration is that whilst casual business attire is now the norm in many \nsections of the business, each individual employee is required to dress appropriately \naccording to the nature of his/her job and the enviro nment in which he/she works.  Even \nthough all roles may not interact directly with clients, staff should note that clients are on \nthe premises almost every day and decisions they make about our business may be \ninfluenced by the image presented by our emplo yees.  To clients, our employees are Mastek \n(UK) Limited.   \n   \n33.3.  General Rules     \n33.3.1.  Mondays - Thursdays inclusive will be normal business dress.  For anyone scheduled \nto meet internal and external customers directly, this will almost always mean  a suit \nand tie for men (or similar level of formality and smartness), with equivalent formal \nbusiness attire for women.  Business dress is not obligatory in other areas, but the \noverall impression should still be smart.  For example, shirts should have co llars, \njeans (of any colour), trainers, sports shirts or shorts are not considered appropriate \nfor those working within our offices.     \n33.3.2.  Friday is currently designated a ""dress down"" day. There will be a notice on Reception \ninforming visitors that t his is the practice.  Anyone scheduling a meeting may invite \nvisitors to also dress down if they wish.     \n33.3.3.  Mastek (UK) Limited reserves the right to cease the practice of ""dress down"" days     \nif at any stage we feel this is compromising our reputa tion or adversely affecting \nour business.     \n   \n33.4.

Purpose      \nThe purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines that are specific to Mastek UK regarding \nharassment. This policy applies to all employees on Company standard terms and conditions. \nIt may/may not apply to employees on non -standard terms and conditi ons. Please contact \nHR if clarification is required of how this policy applies.    \n34.2.  Introduction     \n34.2.1.  In line with the Mastek Value of Respect for the Individual and in support of the \nEqual Opportunities policy, it is the Company's intention th at all employees have a \nright to be treated with dignity, that any form of harassment at work will not be \npermitted or condoned and that employees have a right to report complaints of \nharassment should it occur. These guidelines cover work and work -related  social \nevents (formal or informal). Work related social events constitute an extension of \nthe workplace.      \n34.2.2.  The Company has a responsibility to take complaints of harassment seriously and \nensure that correct and quick action is taken in line wit h the policy and the \nCompany's stance against harassment.     \n34.2.3.  If an employee believes that he or she is being harassed then, depending on the \ncircumstances, he or she can choose to deal with this either formally or informally. \nIt is not necessary f or the informal route to have been exhausted before the formal \nroute is invoked. However, in some cases an informal approach, either by the \nemployee, or the employee and someone who the employee has asked to support \nhim or her, is often enough to prevent a  repeat of any unwanted behaviour and \nresolve the problem. Details of all of the options which are available to the employee \nif he or she believes that he or she is being harassed are set out below.   \n        \n34.3.
