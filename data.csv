Purpose      \nThe purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines that are specific to Mastek UK regarding \nharassment. This policy applies to all employees on Company standard terms and conditions. \nIt may/may not apply to employees on non -standard terms and conditi ons. Please contact \nHR if clarification is required of how this policy applies.    \n34.2.  Introduction     \n34.2.1.  In line with the Mastek Value of Respect for the Individual and in support of the \nEqual Opportunities policy, it is the Company's intention th at all employees have a \nright to be treated with dignity, that any form of harassment at work will not be \npermitted or condoned and that employees have a right to report complaints of \nharassment should it occur.

If an employee believes that he or she is being harassed then, depending on the \ncircumstances, he or she can choose to deal with this either formally or informally. \nIt is not necessary f or the informal route to have been exhausted before the formal \nroute is invoked. However, in some cases an informal approach, either by the \nemployee, or the employee and someone who the employee has asked to support \nhim or her, is often enough to prevent a  repeat of any unwanted behaviour and \nresolve the problem. Details of all of the options which are available to the employee \nif he or she believes that he or she is being harassed are set out below.   \n        \n34.3.  What is Harassment ?     \nHarassment may b e defined as unwanted or offensive behaviour by one or more \nemployee(s) towards another.

This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) has been introduced by the \nOrganization to ensure consistency of our standards of business conduct on a worldwide \nbasis.   \n   \n1.2.    The Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures and serves as a guide \nto ethical decision -making  and behaviors expected of all Mastekeers.

All \nStakeho lders must become familiar with this Code and must conduct themselves in \naccordance with these policies and seek to avoid the appearance of improper behavior or \nto bring the Organization into disrepute.   \n   \n1.3.

2,What is Mastek's policy regarding age discrimination in the workplace?,"[""   \n  \n  Division : HRD   Doc. Name :Code of Business  Conduct & Ethics   Version : 4.2   \nDocument Classification: Internal   Date : 20-Nov-2020 Page : 34 of 38   \n39.9.  Age     \nDiscrimination against a person on the grounds of their actual or perceived age (whether \nyounger or older) is unacceptable and Mastek is committed to ensuring equality of opportunity \nfor all employees regardless of age.   \n   \n   \n39.10.  Disability and Reasonable Adjustments     \nPurpose: If a Mastekeer has a disability or has become disabled, Mastek is required under \nthe Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to make reasonable adjustments to  ensure that the \nemploye e can effectively do his work. The range of conditions which qualify under this \nlegislation is wide and can include both physical and mental conditions, for example: \nmobility, sight, hearing, diabetes, dyslexia, thyroid conditions, schizophrenia, stress and \ndepression. The impact these conditions have on an employee’s ability to do his job must \nbe significant  and will normally have already  lasted for 12 months or be expected to last for \n12 months. If there is a possibility of the ill ness or condition being covered by the Disability \nDiscrimination Act, the Mastekeer must talk to his Manager or HR Manager at the earliest \nopportunit y. Alternatively, he can record details of your disability within Employee Self - \nService which will alert h is HR Manager to your disability. Informing the Company of the \nMastekeer’s disability will allow us to obtain the best advice to help him. This will usually \ninvolve working with the individual and our independent Occupational Health Adviser to \nensure that any adjustments we make will enable the employee to fulfill your his potential. \nThe advice we receive will enable reasonable adjustments to be made which may involve \nacquiring special equipment for the concerned employee like a keyboard or special chair, \narranging transport or making adjustments to the employee’s working arrangements, such \nas altering working hours or transferring you to fill an alternative vacancy. These are just \nexamples and reasonable adjustments will be defined according to the Mastekee r’s \ncircumstances and the Company's operational needs. In order to assist us with making \nadjustments, the Mastekeer should inform us of any needs, or changes to needs, as soon \nas possible. Discrimination and harassment on the grounds of a person's disabili ty, such as \nviolating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or \noffensive environment will not be tolerated in any form.   \n   \n39.11.  HIV and AIDS     \nMastek recognizes that HIV is a workplace issue and wishes to res pond sensitively and \npractically to the difficult challenges that HIV and AIDS can present at work. Discrimination \nagainst employees including harassment, spreading rumors about an employee's suspected \nHIV status or a refusal to work with an employee livin g with or affected by HIV and AIDS \nwill not be tolerated. The HIV status of an employee is personal information that should \nnot be recorded in any way that may be easily accessible and should not be shared without \nthe employee's consent. Sickness and medic al certificates supplied to HR will be kept \nconfidential, unless the employee consents to any further disclosure. If an employee learns \nof a colleague's HIV status, they must not disclose this information without the individual's \nexplicit consent. Similarl y, any advice or information about HIV or AIDS sought by an \nemployee should remain confidential. We will make every reasonable effort to enable \nHIVpositive employees to remain in employment and we will work with them to make \nreasonable adjustments to their  role where this is appropriate.    \n   \n39.12.  Harassment & Bullying     \nHarassment can be described as behavior that is unwanted, unwelcome and undermines a \nperson's dignity at work. It is behavior which a Mastekeer, a colleague, a client or a supplier \nfinds intimidating, upsetting, embarrassing, humiliating or personally offensive. \nHarassment may or may not be connected to discrimination. Harassment in any form will \nnot be tolerated within Mastek. Certain conduct may be offensive to employees, even if it \nis not directed at them. It is immaterial whether harassment is intentional or not. It is the \neffect that the behavior has on the recipient that""]",Mastek's policy regarding age discrimination in the workplace is that discrimination against a person on the grounds of their actual or perceived age (whether younger or older) is unacceptable.

Discrimination can take t wo forms, direct and \nindirect.   \n   \n39.4.2.  If an employee feels that s/he is being discriminated against, or if s/he believes that \nsomeone else's behavior, including that of a client or a supplier is potentially \ndiscriminatory, they should talk to their M anager or HR Manager immediately. If they \ndo not feel comfortable raising the issue with either of those people, the employee can \ncontact one of the Directors. Mastekeers also have the option of raising a formal \ngrievance under the Company's grievance proc edure if the matter cannot be resolved \ninformally or is too serious for an informal approach to be appropriate. The claim will \nbe investigated fully and disciplinary action could be taken if discrimination is proven. \nIn the event of a claim of discriminati on by a client or supplier, the Company will notify \na senior member of their organization, so that they may take appropriate action. In \nsuch circumstances, the Company will also take steps to ensure that our employees are \nfully supported and, if appropriat e, moved away from any such unwanted or \nunacceptable behavior.    \n   \n39.5.  Gender and gender identity    \nMastek will not tolerate any discrimination on the grounds of a person's gender. This \nincludes treating someone less favorably because they are on mate rnity leave. Sexual \nharassment is any harassing conduct which is based on the gender of the recipient and it \nis not permitted in any form. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome advances or other \nconduct of a sexual nature, sending jokes or e -mails of a s exually offensive nature, gestures \nor explicit pictures or words, or any other conduct which leaves the recipient feeling \nthreatened or compromised.    \n   \n39.6.  Race     \nTreating someone less favorably as a result of their race or ethnic or national origin s is \nunlawful and will not be tolerated in any form within Mastek. Racial harassment can include \nderogatory remarks, racially explicit statements or jokes, stereotyping and 'nicknames'. Such \nbehavior is unacceptable.     \n   \n39.7.  Sexual Orientation     \nTreating someone less favorably as a result of their sexual orientation is unlawful and will \nnot be tolerated in any form. Discrimination on the basis of a person's actual or perceived \nsexual orientation is not acceptable.     \n \n39.8.  Religion and Belief     \nFor the purposes of the regulations governing discrimination on religion and belief, there are \nthree essential elements that are necessary to meet the definition of religion. These are a \nbelief in a Supreme Being, worship of that Supreme Being and the exist ence of a group of \npeople who observe a set of beliefs, values, customs and practices set down by and through \nthe Supreme Being. Generally, belief does not cover philosophical or political beliefs. \nDiscrimination or harassment on the grounds of actual or p erceived religion or beliefs is not \nacceptable. Whilst the Company respects individual observance of differing religions, religious \nholidays that are not designated as UK public holidays must be taken as holiday or unpaid \nleave (subject to authorization re quirements laid out in the Company's holiday policy).   \n   ""]","If an employee feels that they are being discriminated against, they should talk to their Manager or HR Manager immediately.

Introduction     \n33.1.1.  Our employees are ambassadors for our business, and represent us whenever they \nmeet customers. We, therefore, a sk that their appearance and conduct present us \nin a professional light at all times.  For this reason, we have introduced the following \nPolicy on business dress.  This Policy is not contractual but sets out the standards \nwe expect.     \n33.1.2.  We aim to b e fair and reasonable, and for our requirements to apply with equal \nformality to both sexes. Should any employee have any difficulty in complying with \nour dress code on grounds of sex, race, disability, religion, belief or sexual \norientation, please raise this initially with your Line Manager, and failing a \nsatisfactory resolution, through the Grievance Procedure. Employees are permitted \nto wear clothing required by their religion if this has no detrimental impact on \nperforming their role successfully.   \n   \n33.2.  Client Perception     \nOur overall consideration is that whilst casual business attire is now the norm in many \nsections of the business, each individual employee is required to dress appropriately \naccording to the nature of his/her job and the enviro nment in which he/she works.  Even \nthough all roles may not interact directly with clients, staff should note that clients are on \nthe premises almost every day and decisions they make about our business may be \ninfluenced by the image presented by our emplo yees.

For example, shirts should have co llars, \njeans (of any colour), trainers, sports shirts or shorts are not considered appropriate \nfor those working within our offices.     \n33.3.2.  Friday is currently designated a ""dress down"" day. There will be a notice on Reception \ninforming visitors that t his is the practice.

Any allegations of harassment will be fully investigated. Harassment can take a \nnumber of forms. This is by no means an exhaustive list but examples ar e non verbal, \nverbal and physical.    \n   \n      \n39.13.  Bullying     \nBullying is not dissimilar to harassment. However it usually involves the misuse of power \nor intimidation, leaving the individual feeling hurt, vulnerable, compromised, threatened, \ndisengag ed, angry or helpless. Examples of potentially bullying behavior include: public \nhumiliation, put -downs or ridicule, this can  also occur via email, reprimanding an employee \nin front of other employees when this could be done in  private, personal insults and name \ncalling, instantaneous rages, often over trivial matters, persistent  criticism, singling out an \nemployee for unjustified criticism, withholding essential information, removing  areas of \nresponsibility without consultation, requiring menial tasks to be undertaken frequently \nwhich may be deemed inappropriate to a person's role, aggressive behavior or threats \ndirected at an employee, including verbal abuse,  turning  own leave for no objective \nreason, persistent placing of excessive demands on employ ees, setting of unrealistic targets \nor objectives, or the changing of targets or objectives without good reason, manner of  \naddressing an employee, physical attacks , deliberate and wrongful attributions of blame. \nBullying should  not be confused with legi timate actions by a Manager to encourage an \nimprovement in an employee's  performance such as: negative feedback from your \nManager or a client which is intended as constructive  comment, defining areas for personal \nimprovement(s), reasonable instructions g iven to you by the  manager or a client, \nperformance management and the setting of work related targets and objectives or  \nappropriate action taken under the Disciplinary and Grievance Policy or a Personal \nImprovement Plan.    \nIf a Mastekeer believes that someone else's behavior, including that of a client or supplier, \nis personally offensive, socially unacceptable or fails to respect an individual’s rights as an \nindividual, the concerned person should tell them their behavior is unwelcome and give \nthem som e examples. In some instances this will solve the problem, as they may be  \nunaware of the effect their behavior is having . If the employee feels unable to approach \nthe individual or if the harassment or bullying continues, they should make a diary note of  \ndates, times and incidents and must speak with their Manager as soon as they feel able. If \nthe Mastekeer is unable to do this they should talk to their HR. Where they believe bullying \nis occurring, they will speak to the harasser on your behalf to make it  clear that the behavior \nis unacceptable and that it must stop. If the harassment is serious in nature the matter will \nbe fully investigated and this may lead to disciplinary action and potentially dismissal if an \nemployee is found to have acted in this wa y.

Age     \nDiscrimination against a person on the grounds of their actual or perceived age (whether \nyounger or older) is unacceptable and Mastek is committed to ensuring equality of opportunity \nfor all employees regardless of age.   \n   \n   \n39.10.  Disability and Reasonable Adjustments     \nPurpose: If a Mastekeer has a disability or has become disabled, Mastek is required under \nthe Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to make reasonable adjustments to  ensure that the \nemploye e can effectively do his work. The range of conditions which qualify under this \nlegislation is wide and can include both physical and mental conditions, for example: \nmobility, sight, hearing, diabetes, dyslexia, thyroid conditions, schizophrenia, stress and \ndepression. The impact these conditions have on an employee’s ability to do his job must \nbe significant  and will normally have already  lasted for 12 months or be expected to last for \n12 months. If there is a possibility of the ill ness or condition being covered by the Disability \nDiscrimination Act, the Mastekeer must talk to his Manager or HR Manager at the earliest \nopportunit y. Alternatively, he can record details of your disability within Employee Self - \nService which will alert h is HR Manager to your disability. Informing the Company of the \nMastekeer’s disability will allow us to obtain the best advice to help him. This will usually \ninvolve working with the individual and our independent Occupational Health Adviser to \nensure that any adjustments we make will enable the employee to fulfill your his potential. \nThe advice we receive will enable reasonable adjustments to be made which may involve \nacquiring special equipment for the concerned employee like a keyboard or special chair, \narranging transport or making adjustments to the employee’s working arrangements, such \nas altering working hours or transferring you to fill an alternative vacancy. These are just \nexamples and reasonable adjustments will be defined according to the Mastekee r’s \ncircumstances and the Company's operational needs. In order to assist us with making \nadjustments, the Mastekeer should inform us of any needs, or changes to needs, as soon \nas possible. Discrimination and harassment on the grounds of a person's disabili ty, such as \nviolating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or \noffensive environment will not be tolerated in any form.   \n   \n39.11.  HIV and AIDS     \nMastek recognizes that HIV is a workplace issue and wishes to res pond sensitively and \npractically to the difficult challenges that HIV and AIDS can present at work. Discrimination \nagainst employees including harassment, spreading rumors about an employee's suspected \nHIV status or a refusal to work with an employee livin g with or affected by HIV and AIDS \nwill not be tolerated. The HIV status of an employee is personal information that should \nnot be recorded in any way that may be easily accessible and should not be shared without \nthe employee's consent. Sickness and medic al certificates supplied to HR will be kept \nconfidential, unless the employee consents to any further disclosure. If an employee learns \nof a colleague's HIV status, they must not disclose this information without the individual's \nexplicit consent. Similarl y, any advice or information about HIV or AIDS sought by an \nemployee should remain confidential. We will make every reasonable effort to enable \nHIVpositive employees to remain in employment and we will work with them to make \nreasonable adjustments to their  role where this is appropriate.    \n   \n39.12.  Harassment & Bullying     \nHarassment can be described as behavior that is unwanted, unwelcome and undermines a \nperson's dignity at work. It is behavior which a Mastekeer, a colleague, a client or a supplier \nfinds intimidating, upsetting, embarrassing, humiliating or personally offensive. \nHarassment may or may not be connected to discrimination.

Discrimination can take t wo forms, direct and \nindirect.   \n   \n39.4.2.  If an employee feels that s/he is being discriminated against, or if s/he believes that \nsomeone else's behavior, including that of a client or a supplier is potentially \ndiscriminatory, they should talk to their M anager or HR Manager immediately. If they \ndo not feel comfortable raising the issue with either of those people, the employee can \ncontact one of the Directors. Mastekeers also have the option of raising a formal \ngrievance under the Company's grievance proc edure if the matter cannot be resolved \ninformally or is too serious for an informal approach to be appropriate. The claim will \nbe investigated fully and disciplinary action could be taken if discrimination is proven. \nIn the event of a claim of discriminati on by a client or supplier, the Company will notify \na senior member of their organization, so that they may take appropriate action. In \nsuch circumstances, the Company will also take steps to ensure that our employees are \nfully supported and, if appropriat e, moved away from any such unwanted or \nunacceptable behavior.    \n   \n39.5.  Gender and gender identity    \nMastek will not tolerate any discrimination on the grounds of a person's gender. This \nincludes treating someone less favorably because they are on mate rnity leave. Sexual \nharassment is any harassing conduct which is based on the gender of the recipient and it \nis not permitted in any form. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome advances or other \nconduct of a sexual nature, sending jokes or e -mails of a s exually offensive nature, gestures \nor explicit pictures or words, or any other conduct which leaves the recipient feeling \nthreatened or compromised.    \n   \n39.6.  Race     \nTreating someone less favorably as a result of their race or ethnic or national origin s is \nunlawful and will not be tolerated in any form within Mastek. Racial harassment can include \nderogatory remarks, racially explicit statements or jokes, stereotyping and 'nicknames'. Such \nbehavior is unacceptable.     \n   \n39.7.  Sexual Orientation     \nTreating someone less favorably as a result of their sexual orientation is unlawful and will \nnot be tolerated in any form. Discrimination on the basis of a person's actual or perceived \nsexual orientation is not acceptable.     \n \n39.8.  Religion and Belief     \nFor the purposes of the regulations governing discrimination on religion and belief, there are \nthree essential elements that are necessary to meet the definition of religion. These are a \nbelief in a Supreme Being, worship of that Supreme Being and the exist ence of a group of \npeople who observe a set of beliefs, values, customs and practices set down by and through \nthe Supreme Being. Generally, belief does not cover philosophical or political beliefs. \nDiscrimination or harassment on the grounds of actual or p erceived religion or beliefs is not \nacceptable.
